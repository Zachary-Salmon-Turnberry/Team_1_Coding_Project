## 2. Example


## Status

Proposed

## Context

Inspector Clouseau the Claim Inspector is out in the field assessing a car crash involving Mr. Bond, who has PDR Insurance. Clouseau pulls out his iPhone and opens up the handy dandy PDR Insurance mobile application to search for Mr. Bond's informaiton. Behind the scenes, the application is performing an HTTPS GET request using one of the API endpoints developed by Turnberry Solutions. This endpoint processes the HTTPS request and sends Mr. Bond's information from the database to the front end to be displayed. Clouseau then adds a new claim to Mr. Bond's profile and fills in the relevant information for this claim. Clouseau then gets Mr. Bond's signature consenting to store this information in the PDR Insurance database and presses the save button which performs an HTTPS PUT request to add the new information to Adamâ€™s table in the database.
