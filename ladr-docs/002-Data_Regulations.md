## 1. Data Regulaton


## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to develop and construct a system that regulates data privacy for each user. This will allow our system to abide by legal rules and ensure that each user in their respected location has their data protected.  

## Decision

This data regulation will be designed by referencing information from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is implmented throughout the EU. This law accomplishes everything we intend to regulate within our system. 

## Consequences

We must account for users in different regions of the world (North, Central, South America) and distribute fines if regulations are not met.
